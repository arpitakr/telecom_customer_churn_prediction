Project Description:
In this project, we will work on a dataset containing information about customers of a telecommunications company. 
The goal is to build a predictive model that can identify customers who are likely to churn (cancel their subscription) in the near future. 
By identifying these customers in advance, the company can take proactive measures to retain them and improve customer satisfaction.

Dataset:
We can obtain the dataset from a reliable source or use a pre-existing dataset available in popular data science libraries such as scikit-learn or TensorFlow. 
The dataset should include relevant information about customers, such as demographics, services subscribed, billing information, and churn status (whether they have churned or not).

Tasks to Perform:

Data Exploration: Perform exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the dataset. Examine the distributions of different features, check for missing values, 
and identify any patterns or correlations.

Data Preprocessing: Preprocess the dataset by handling missing values, transforming categorical variables into numerical representations (e.g., one-hot encoding), 
and normalizing numerical features if necessary.

Feature Selection: Identify the most relevant features for predicting customer churn. You can use techniques like correlation analysis or employ feature 
importance algorithms such as random forests or gradient boosting.

Model Building: Select an appropriate classification algorithm (e.g., logistic regression, random forest, or support vector machines) and build a predictive 
model using the training data. Split the dataset into training and testing sets for model evaluation.

Model Evaluation: Assess the performance of the predictive model using evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. 
Additionally, consider using techniques like cross-validation or ROC curves to evaluate the model's robustness and generalizability.

Model Optimization: Fine-tune the model parameters or explore different algorithms to improve the model's performance. 
Techniques like grid search or random search can help you find the optimal hyperparameters.

Predicting Churn: Use the trained model to predict customer churn on new, unseen data. Analyze the predictions and provide insights 
to the telecommunications company on which customers are most likely to churn and potential strategies for retention.

Deployment and Presentation: Package the model into a user-friendly application or deploy it as an API for real-time predictions. 
Create a presentation or report summarizing your findings, methodology, and recommendations for the telecommunications company.
